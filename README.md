# Code Samples
These are sample files from a personal project where I used React & NextJS to create a finance/budgeting application, experimenting with various APIs and an AI agent to help users categorize transactions.

Stack:
Frontend --> React(Javascript)
Backend --> MongoDB, NextJS, server-side session handling with NextAuth

Files: 
- plaid-api-route.js --> backend for plaid integration
- openai-categorize-route.js --> backend for ai-powered categorization feature
  
Users can:
- Connect bank accounts securely via Plaid
- Define custom budget categories
- View synced transactions
- Receive AI-generated category suggestions with confidence scores
- Review and confirm suggested classifications
